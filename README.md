# First-Assignment
This is your first assignment!

Eek! First assignment! So scary. Your first assignment is this:

1) edit this file and add your name and e-mail to the list below!

2) make a website.

3) make a repository in the GitHub organization (name it whatever you want!)

4) find a piece of design, or anything visual really, that you like. doesn't matter what! could be a picture of a picture of a rock with a drawing of a rock on it. BRING THE URL TO CLASS.

(optional, but do it...)
5) upload your website code to the repository you make.

These are all new skills. Try and Google around if you get stuck, or e-mail me!
